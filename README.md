# Abstract

Rural land use classification has many usages in a wide range of fields, including food security, disaster 
management, tourism development, and rural development. This leads to a significant need to carry out surveys for land use in the 
rural region. On-field surveys by expert surveyors are currently the main approach, but difficult and limited access to the survey 
location makes this approach often expensive and laborious, especially for large-scale survey tasks. Seeing the successful 
implementation of deep-learning technology for semantic segmentation, this study's goal is to explore an alternative workflow based 
on the U-Net model architecture to apply automatic multi-class classification for land use in rural regions. U-Net is a deep learning 
model architecture that has been tested by many researchers and gives positive results for semantic segmentation. We experime nted 
on 765 orthophoto images and masks dataset consist 9 land use classes from Padasuka Village in West Java. Padasuka village is an 
agricultural village where the most dominant land use is used to grow staple crops. Experimental results calculated by Jaccard Index, 
show a value of 0.8458 for the train set and 0.46537 for the test set. It shows that the presented model architecture needs to be 
improved but has the potential to be used as an alternative for multi-class semantic segmentation in rural regions.
